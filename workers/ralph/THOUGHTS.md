[REPLACE: How do you measure if this project is successful? Define quantifiable metrics.]

This project is successful when:

1. **[Metric Category 1]** - [Specific measurable outcome]
2. **[Metric Category 2]** - [Specific measurable outcome]

5. **[Metric Category 5]** - [Specific measurable outcome]

## Source Code Definition

[REPLACE: Define what counts as "source code" vs reference materials in your project]

For this project, "source code" means:

- **`[directory/]`** - [Description of what lives here]
- **`[file-pattern]`** - [Description of these files]
- **`[directory/]`** - [Description of what lives here]

**NOT source code:**

- `[directory/]` - [Explanation why - e.g., "Generated files", "External dependencies", "Read-only reference"]

## Knowledge Base Integration

> **Brain Integration (Optional):** If `./brain/` exists, this project can leverage shared knowledge. Otherwise, the project works standalone.

[REPLACE: How does this project use the brain repository's knowledge base?]

**If brain repository is available**, this project can reference:

- **Performance Patterns:** `./brain/skills/domains/frontend/react-patterns.md` (if applicable)
- **Domain Conventions:** `./brain/skills/domains/[relevant-domain].md` (if applicable)
- **Project Learnings:** `./brain/skills/projects/[this-project-slug].md` (project-specific patterns that might benefit other projects)

**Standalone mode:** If brain is not present, rely on project-local documentation in `docs/` and standard best practices.

## Technical Context

[REPLACE: Key technical decisions, architecture choices, or constraints]

### Technology Stack

- **Language(s):** [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Bash]
- **Framework(s):** [e.g., Next.js, React, Express]
