# Value Proposition

Creates clear, specific, non-fluffy hero headlines and subheadlines that communicate value immediately.

## Quick Reference

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Headline | What you do + for whom | 6-12 words |
| Subheadline | How you do it / key benefit | 15-25 words |
| Supporting text | Proof or context | 1-2 sentences |
| CTA | What to do next | 2-5 words |

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- Writing hero section copy
- Current headline is vague ("Welcome to our website")
- Value isn't immediately clear
- Bounce rate is high

## The Value Proposition Formula

```text
[End result/transformation] + [for specific audience] + [without common pain/objection]
```text

**Examples:**

- "Build websites 10x faster — without writing code"
- "Find your calm. Rebuild your confidence." (for therapy)
- "Fresh meals delivered — no cooking, no cleanup"

## Headline Patterns That Work

### Pattern 1: Outcome-Focused

What the customer GETS, not what you DO.

```text
❌ "Professional Therapy Services"
✅ "Find your calm. Rebuild your confidence."

❌ "Web Development Agency"
✅ "Websites that turn visitors into customers"
```text

### Pattern 2: Problem-Solution

Acknowledge the pain, offer the solution.

```text
"Tired of [pain point]? [Solution statement]."

"Tired of feeling overwhelmed? Get clarity in your first session."
```text

### Pattern 3: Specific + Credible

Numbers and specifics build trust.

```text
"Join 10,000+ professionals who [outcome]"
"Reduce anxiety in 6 weeks with evidence-based therapy"
```text

### Pattern 4: Question Hook

Engage with a question they're already asking.

```text
"Ready to feel like yourself again?"
"What would you do with 10 extra hours a week?"
```text

### Pattern 5: Simple Statement

Sometimes direct is best.

```text
"Therapy that works."
"Email marketing for creators."
```text

## Subheadline Rules

The subheadline supports the headline with:

- WHO it's for (if not in headline)
- HOW it works (method/approach)
- KEY differentiator (what makes you different)

```markdown
**Headline:** Find your calm. Rebuild your confidence.
**Subheadline:** Professional therapy for anxiety, trauma, and life transitions — online or in-person in Johannesburg.
```text

## Hero Section Structure

```markdown
1. **Headline** (biggest text)
   - Clear value statement
   
2. **Subheadline** (medium text)
   - Supporting detail
   
3. **Trust line** (small text, optional)
   - "HPCSA Registered | 10+ years experience"
   - "Trusted by 500+ clients"
   
4. **CTA Button**
   - Primary action
   
5. **Secondary CTA** (optional)
   - Lower commitment option
```text

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Welcome to our website" | Says nothing | Lead with value |
| Feature-focused | Customers want outcomes | Focus on transformation |
| Too clever/cute | Confuses people | Clarity over cleverness |
| Jargon | Excludes people | Use customer's language |
| Too long | Won't be read | 6-12 words headline |
| No specificity | Forgettable | Add concrete details |

## Testing Your Value Proposition

Ask these questions:

1. **Clear?** Can someone understand in 5 seconds?
2. **Specific?** Does it apply only to you?
3. **Compelling?** Does it make someone want to learn more?
4. **Believable?** Can you back it up?

## Example

**Project:** Psychology practice website

```markdown
## Hero Copy Options

### Option 1 (Outcome-focused)
**Headline:** Find your calm. Rebuild your confidence.
**Subheadline:** Professional therapy for anxiety, trauma, and life transitions — online or in-person in Johannesburg.
