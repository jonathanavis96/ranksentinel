# Section Composer

Assembles the optimal section order for landing pages and service pages based on user psychology and conversion best practices.

## Quick Reference

| Section Type | Purpose | Typical Position |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| Hero | Hook attention, state value | Always first |
| Social Proof | Build trust quickly | Near top (2-3) |
| Services/Offer | What you provide | Middle |
| Process | Reduce uncertainty | After services |
| About/Story | Human connection | Middle-lower |
| FAQ | Handle objections | Near bottom |
| CTA | Convert | Bottom + repeated |

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- Planning a new landing page
- Page has content but poor flow
- High bounce rate on key pages
- Users not scrolling to CTA

## The Universal Page Flow

Every effective page follows this psychological sequence:

```text
1. ATTENTION → Hero (what is this, is it for me?)
2. TRUST → Social proof (can I trust this?)
3. VALUE → Services/benefits (what do I get?)
4. CLARITY → Process/how it works (what happens next?)
5. CONNECTION → About/story (who is behind this?)
6. OBJECTIONS → FAQ (what about my concerns?)
7. ACTION → CTA (what do I do now?)

## Section Spacing Rules

| Between Sections | Spacing |
|------------------|---------|
| Major sections | 80-120px |
| Sub-sections | 40-60px |
| Within sections | 20-40px |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Hero with no CTA | Misses hottest attention | Always have CTA in hero |
| All text, no breaks | Wall of text = bounce | Use sections, images, whitespace |
| CTA only at bottom | Many don't scroll that far | Repeat CTA 2-3 times |
| FAQ at top | Premature objection handling | Put FAQ lower, after value |
| About before Services | They don't care about you yet | Services first, about later |
