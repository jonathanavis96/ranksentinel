# Audience Mapping

Identifies target user, their pains, desired outcomes, and the primary CTA that resonates.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Who is this for? | Specific person profile |
| What's their pain? | Problem they're trying to solve |
| What do they want? | Desired outcome in their words |
| What makes them act? | Trigger that drives conversion |

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:

- Target audience is vague ("everyone")
- Copy doesn't resonate with visitors
- High traffic but low conversions
- Multiple audience segments to prioritize

## Procedure

### 1. Define Primary Audience

```markdown
## Primary Audience Profile

**Who:** [Specific demographic + psychographic]
**Age range:** [X-Y]
**Location:** [Geographic if relevant]
**Situation:** [What's happening in their life right now]

**They say things like:**
- "[Quote that shows their mindset]"
- "[Another quote]"

**They search for:**
- "[Actual search terms they'd use]"
```text

### 2. Map Pain → Desire → Action

```markdown
## Pain-Desire-Action Map

| Pain (Problem) | Desire (Outcome) | Action (CTA) |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| [What hurts] | [What they want] | [What to offer] |
| Feeling overwhelmed | Feel calm and in control | "Book a free consultation" |
| Don't know where to start | Clear first step | "Take our assessment" |
```text

### 3. Identify Trust Barriers

What stops them from converting?

```markdown
## Trust Barriers

| Barrier | Evidence Needed |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Is this person qualified?" | Credentials, certifications |
| "Will this work for me?" | Testimonials from similar people |
| "Is it too expensive?" | Pricing transparency or "worth it" framing |
| "Is it safe to share?" | Privacy assurances, professional standards |
```text

### 4. Prioritize Segments (if multiple)

```markdown
## Audience Prioritization

| Segment | Size | Value | Fit | Priority |
|---------|------|-------|-----|----------|
| [Segment A] | Large | High | Good | 🥇 Primary |
| [Segment B] | Medium | Medium | Good | 🥈 Secondary |
| [Segment C] | Small | High | Okay | 🥉 Tertiary |
```text

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Our audience is everyone" | Can't speak to no one specifically | Pick ONE primary audience |
| Features over outcomes | People buy outcomes, not features | "Feel calm" not "Get 6 sessions" |
| Ignoring search intent | Miss how they actually find you | Use their language |
| Skipping trust barriers | Wonder why traffic doesn't convert | Address objections explicitly |

## Example

**Project:** Psychology practice website

```markdown
## Primary Audience Profile

**Who:** Professional adults experiencing anxiety or life transitions
**Age range:** 28-50
**Location:** Johannesburg, South Africa (or remote-friendly)
**Situation:** Functional but struggling. Working, maybe parenting, but feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or emotionally exhausted.

**They say things like:**
- "I've been putting this off for months but I know I need help"
- "I tried therapy before but it didn't click"
- "I just need someone who gets it"

**They search for:**
- "psychologist near me"
- "online therapy south africa"
- "anxiety therapist johannesburg"
- "how to know if I need therapy"

## Pain-Desire-Action Map

| Pain | Desire | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Anxiety affecting work/relationships | Feel grounded and capable | "Book your first session" |
| Past trauma resurfacing | Process and move forward | "Learn about my approach" |
| Major life transition | Clarity and direction | "Schedule a consultation" |

## Trust Barriers

| Barrier | Evidence Needed |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Are they actually qualified?" | HPCSA registration, Psychology Today badge |
| "Will they understand my situation?" | Specific mention of their issue (trauma, anxiety, etc.) |
| "What's the process like?" | Clear "how it works" section |
| "Can I afford this?" | Session rates or "investment" framing |
