## The Five Universal Objections

Every purchase decision faces these:

| # | Objection | Customer Thinks | Your Response |
|---|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Trust** | "Who are you? Can I believe you?" | Credentials, social proof, transparency |
| 2 | **Need** | "Is this really for me?" | Specific problem/audience matching |
| 3 | **Price** | "Is it worth the money?" | Value framing, ROI, comparison |
| 4 | **Time** | "Do I have time for this?" | Process clarity, time investment |
| 5 | **Risk** | "What if it doesn't work?" | Guarantees, testimonials, first step |
