# Code Review Patterns

<!-- covers: code-review, semantic-linting, logic-bugs, pre-commit-checklist, semantic-analysis -->

Patterns for catching logic bugs and semantic issues that automated linters miss. This guide complements pre-commit hooks by documenting human/LLM-reviewable patterns that require semantic understanding.

## Quick Reference

| Category | Common Issues | Detection Method |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Regex Capture Groups | Delimiters inside `()`, wrong match extraction | Manual inspection of `BASH_REMATCH`, captured text |
| Dead Code | Unreachable cleanup, unused functions | Trace execution paths, check all branches |
| Variable Scope | Undefined vars, wrong scope, shadowing built-ins | Check function params vs usage, verify initialization |
| Code Examples | Missing imports, undefined variables | Copy-paste test in clean environment |
| Security | SQL injection, XSS, credential leaks | Check input sanitization, parameterization |
| Error Handling | Inconsistent patterns, hardcoded values | Verify error paths use actual runtime state |
| API Deprecation | Outdated syntax, removed features | Check against current docs, version constraints |
| String Escaping | Unescaped backslashes, unquoted variables | Check regex strings use raw mode, variables quoted |
| Loop Bounds | Off-by-one errors, skipped iterations | Verify range matches intent (inclusive vs exclusive) |
| Concurrency | Race conditions, check-then-act | Look for atomic operations, proper locking |
| Type Coercion | Implicit conversions, truthiness bugs | Explicit parsing, `===` in JS, `is` in Python |
| Resource Leaks | Unclosed files, unreleased locks | Check for context managers, `finally` blocks |

## Problem: Beyond Syntax Checking

Automated linters excel at syntax and style but struggle with:

- **Logic errors** - Code runs but doesn't do what it claims (wrong regex capture)
- **Semantic correctness** - Variables are used but never defined (missing imports)
- **Context-dependent bugs** - Cleanup code references wrong variables (scope issues)
- **Example completeness** - Documentation code is missing imports/definitions
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Valid syntax but insecure patterns (SQL injection)
- **Dead code paths** - Functions defined but never called (cleanup handlers)

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Bash Regex Capture Groups

**Issue:** Regex patterns that include delimiters in capture groups, causing incorrect matches.

**Example from PR#5:**

```bash
# ❌ BAD - captures delimiter pipe character
if [[ "$line" =~ ^\|\ *([0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\ *\| ]]; then
    task_id="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"  # Includes trailing " |"
fi

# ✅ GOOD - captures only the task ID
if [[ "$line" =~ ^\|\ *([0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\ * ]]; then
    task_id="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"  # Clean match
fi
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Does the regex pattern include `\|` or other delimiters inside `()`?
- [ ] Are captured groups used in string comparisons or assignments?
- [ ] Would trailing whitespace or delimiters break downstream logic?

**Fix:** Move delimiters outside capture groups, match only the data you need.

### 2. Dead Code with Undefined Variables

**Issue:** Cleanup blocks or error handlers reference variables that don't exist in that scope.

**Example from PR#5:**

```bash
cleanup_and_emit() {
    # ❌ BAD - cleanup() function is never called
    # Variable TEMP_CONFIG from cleanup() is never removed
    release_lock
    emit_completion_status "$1"
}
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are all functions/commands in the cleanup path actually called?
- [ ] Do cleanup handlers reference variables defined in the main flow?
- [ ] Are temp files actually removed before exit?

**Fix:** Trace the execution path and ensure all cleanup code runs. Use `trap` handlers or explicit calls.

**See also:** [cleanup-patterns.md](../languages/shell/cleanup-patterns.md) for trap best practices.

### 3. Code Example Completeness

**Issue:** Documentation examples are missing imports, variable definitions, or context needed to run.

**Example from PR#5:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - time.sleep() used but never imported
def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for i in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception:
            time.sleep(2 ** i)  # Missing: import time

# ✅ GOOD - complete example
import time

def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for i in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception:
            time.sleep(2 ** i)
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are all imported modules/functions declared at the top?
- [ ] Are all variables used in examples defined or parameterized?
- [ ] Can the example run standalone (copy-paste test)?
- [ ] Are external dependencies documented?

**Fix patterns:**

1. Add missing imports at the top of the code block
2. Define variables used in examples (or add comments explaining them)
3. Use realistic placeholder values (not `undefined_var`)
4. Test examples in isolation before committing

### 4. Variable Scope and Initialization

**Issue:** Variables used before being set, or assumed to exist from external context.

**Example from PR#5:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - userId never defined, murmurhash not imported, 'hash' shadows built-in
def isEnabledForPercentage(flag, percentage):
    hash = murmurhash(flag + userId)  # Where does userId come from?
    return (hash % 100) < percentage

# ✅ GOOD - parameter or explicit source, proper imports, no built-in shadowing
from murmurhash import murmurhash

def isEnabledForPercentage(flag, user_id, percentage):
    hash_value = murmurhash(f"{flag}{user_id}")
    return (hash_value % 100) < percentage
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are all variables in the function either parameters, local vars, or globals?
- [ ] Do variable names match between definition and use?
- [ ] Are loop variables declared before the loop?

**Fix:** Make all variable sources explicit (parameters, globals with comments, or local assignments).

**See also:** [variable-patterns.md](../languages/shell/variable-patterns.md) for shell-specific rules.

### 5. Security Issues in Examples

**Issue:** Example code demonstrates insecure patterns (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, etc.).

**Example from PR#5:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - SQL injection vulnerability
span.set_attribute("sql.query", f"SELECT * FROM {table}")

# ✅ GOOD - parameterized query
span.set_attribute("sql.query", "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
span.set_attribute("sql.params", str(params))
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are user inputs sanitized or parameterized?
- [ ] Are secrets/tokens redacted in logs/examples?
- [ ] Do examples follow current security best practices?

**Fix:** Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, redact sensitive data.

**See also:** [security-patterns.md](../infrastructure/security-patterns.md)

### 6. Outdated or Deprecated APIs

**Issue:** Documentation uses APIs that have been removed or replaced in newer versions.

**Example from PR#5:**

```bash
# ❌ BAD - recovery.conf removed in PostgreSQL 12+
cat > /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf <<EOF
standby_mode = 'on'
EOF

# ✅ GOOD - modern PostgreSQL recovery
touch /var/lib/postgresql/data/standby.signal
cat >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf <<EOF
primary_conninfo = 'host=primary port=5432'
EOF
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are version-specific APIs documented with version constraints?
- [ ] Have APIs been deprecated since the example was written?
- [ ] Do examples work with the "current" version (not legacy)?

**Fix:** Research current best practices, update examples to modern APIs, add version notes.

### 7. Inconsistent Error Handling

**Issue:** Some code paths handle errors while others silently fail.

**Example from PR#5:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - status hardcoded, missing async def, missing import
def metricsMiddleware(request, call_next):
    start = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    duration = time.time() - start
    metrics.histogram("duration", duration, {"status": "200"})  # Wrong!
    return response

# ✅ GOOD - uses actual status, async def, complete imports
import time

async def metricsMiddleware(request, call_next):
    start = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)
    duration = time.time() - start
    metrics.histogram("duration", duration, {"status": str(response.status_code)})
    return response
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are all error paths handled consistently?
- [ ] Do metrics/logs reflect actual runtime state (not hardcoded values)?
- [ ] Are exceptions propagated or caught appropriately?

**Fix:** Use actual runtime values, not placeholders or assumptions.

## Pre-Commit Review Checklist

Before committing code, manually review:

### Shell Scripts

- [ ] Regex patterns: Are capture groups clean (no delimiters inside `()`)?
- [ ] Cleanup handlers: Do all `trap` or cleanup functions actually run?
- [ ] Variable usage: Are all variables defined before use?

### Python/JavaScript Examples

- [ ] Imports: Are all modules imported at the top?
- [ ] Variables: Are all variables defined or parameterized?
- [ ] Copy-paste test: Can the example run standalone?
- [ ] Security: No SQL injection, XSS, or credential leaks?

### Documentation

- [ ] Version constraints: Are deprecated APIs marked as such?
- [ ] Completeness: Do examples include necessary context?
- [ ] Accuracy: Do hardcoded values match actual runtime behavior?

## Workflow Integration

### During Development

1. Write code with semantic correctness in mind (not just syntax)
2. Test examples in isolation (run them!)
3. Review your own diff before committing

### Before PR

1. Run automated checks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
2. Manual review using checklist above
3. Test at least one example from each modified doc file

### In Code Review

- Look for patterns in this document
- Question assumptions (where do variables come from?)
- Verify examples are complete and secure

## Limitations

**These patterns require human/LLM review** - they cannot be fully automated because:

- Context-dependent logic requires understanding intent
- "Correct" depends on what the code is supposed to do
- Trade-offs exist (completeness vs brevity in examples)

**Future:** Consider custom linting rules or LLM-based semantic checks for high-frequency patterns.

### 8. String Escape Sequences

**Issue:** Escape sequences in strings not properly handled, causing unexpected behavior.

**Example:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - backslash not escaped, breaks regex
pattern = "\d+"  # Actually matches "d+" (literal d)

# ✅ GOOD - raw string or escaped backslash
pattern = r"\d+"  # Raw string (preferred)
pattern = "\\d+"  # Escaped backslash (alternative)
```

```bash
# ❌ BAD - unquoted variable with newlines breaks command
echo $OUTPUT  # Word splitting on newlines

# ✅ GOOD - quoted to preserve formatting
echo "$OUTPUT"
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are regex patterns using raw strings (`r"..."` in Python)?
- [ ] Are shell variables properly quoted when they may contain whitespace?
- [ ] Are JSON strings escaped when embedded in other formats?

**Fix:** Use raw strings for regex, quote shell variables, escape special characters appropriately.

### 9. Off-by-One Errors in Loops

**Issue:** Loop bounds incorrect, causing skipped or extra iterations.

**Example:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - skips last item
for i in range(len(items) - 1):
    process(items[i])

# ✅ GOOD - processes all items
for i in range(len(items)):
    process(items[i])

# ✅ BETTER - pythonic iteration
for item in items:
    process(item)
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Do loop ranges match intended coverage (inclusive vs exclusive)?
- [ ] Are array indices within bounds (0 to length-1)?
- [ ] Are string slices correct (`[start:end]` excludes `end`)?

**Fix:** Verify loop bounds match intent, prefer idiomatic iteration over manual indexing.

### 10. Race Conditions and Concurrency Issues

**Issue:** Code assumes single-threaded execution but runs in concurrent environment.

**Example:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - race condition (check-then-act)
if not os.path.exists(path):
    os.makedirs(path)  # Another thread might create it first

# ✅ GOOD - atomic operation with error handling
try:
    os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
except FileExistsError:
    pass  # Already created by another thread
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are file operations atomic (no check-then-act patterns)?
- [ ] Are shared resources protected (locks, mutexes)?
- [ ] Do error handlers account for concurrent modifications?

**Fix:** Use atomic operations, proper locking, or idempotent patterns.

### 11. Type Coercion Pitfalls

**Issue:** Implicit type conversions cause unexpected behavior.

**Example:**

```javascript
// ❌ BAD - string concatenation instead of addition
const total = request.query.amount + 10;  // "5010" if amount is "50"

// ✅ GOOD - explicit type conversion
const total = parseInt(request.query.amount, 10) + 10;  // 60
```

```python
# ❌ BAD - truthiness check doesn't distinguish 0 from None
if result:
    process(result)  # Skips valid result of 0

# ✅ GOOD - explicit None check
if result is not None:
    process(result)
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are numeric operations on user input explicitly parsed?
- [ ] Do truthiness checks distinguish between `0`, `""`, `None`, and `False`?
- [ ] Are comparisons type-safe (`===` in JS, `is` vs `==` in Python)?

**Fix:** Explicit type conversions, proper None/null checks, type-safe comparisons.

### 12. Resource Leak Prevention

**Issue:** Resources (files, connections, locks) not properly released.

**Example:**

```python
# ❌ BAD - file not closed on exception
f = open(path, 'w')
process_data(f)  # Might throw exception
f.close()

# ✅ GOOD - context manager ensures cleanup
with open(path, 'w') as f:
    process_data(f)
```

**Detection checklist:**

- [ ] Are files opened with context managers (`with` statement)?
- [ ] Are database connections returned to pool/closed?
- [ ] Are locks released in `finally` blocks or using RAII patterns?

**Fix:** Use context managers, defer statements, or RAII patterns for automatic cleanup.

## Advanced Review Techniques

### Static Analysis for Logic Bugs

Beyond manual review, use these tools for deeper analysis:

```bash
# Python: mypy for type checking
mypy --strict src/

# Python: bandit for security issues
bandit -r src/

# JavaScript: TypeScript for type safety
tsc --noEmit --strict

# Shell: shellcheck with all warnings
shellcheck -x -a script.sh
```

### Code Example Validation

Extract and test code examples automatically:

```bash
# Extract Python code blocks from markdown
awk '/```python/,/```/ {if (!/```/) print}' README.md > test_example.py

# Run with imports check
python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('test_example.py').read())"

# Check for undefined names
pylint --disable=all --enable=undefined-variable test_example.py
```

### Semantic Diff Review

Focus review on semantic changes, not formatting:

```bash
# Ignore whitespace changes in git diff
git diff -w HEAD~1

# Show function-level context
git diff --function-context

# Semantic diff with difftastic
difft --display side-by-side file1.py file2.py
```
