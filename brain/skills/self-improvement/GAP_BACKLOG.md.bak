# Gap Backlog (Auto-maintained by Claude)

Rules:
- Each entry is a missing brain capability discovered during work.
- If a similar entry exists, **UPDATE it** (don't duplicate).
- Include evidence (paths, filenames, brief snippets, or observations).
- Priority:
  - P0 = blocks work / repeatedly causes failure
  - P1 = high leverage / recurring
  - P2 = nice-to-have

## Backlog Items

<!-- Add new entries below this line using the format:

### YYYY-MM-DD — <Suggested Skill Name>
- **Type:** Knowledge / Procedure / Tooling / Pattern / Debugging / Reference
- **Why useful:** <1–2 lines>
- **When triggered:** <what you were trying to do>
- **Evidence:** <paths, filenames, snippets, observations>
- **Priority:** P0 / P1 / P2
- **Status:** Identified / Promoted to SKILL_BACKLOG / Done

### 2026-01-18 — Bash Terminal Control with tput
- **Type:** Tooling / Knowledge
- **Why useful:** Prevents screen flashing/blanking during display refreshes in interactive bash scripts
- **When triggered:** Implementing cursor positioning for top-anchored display in current_ralph_tasks.sh (task P4A.1)
- **Evidence:** 
  - Used `tput cup 0 0` to move cursor to top-left without clearing screen
  - Used `tput ed` to clear from cursor to end of screen
  - Pattern: Replace `clear` command with `tput cup 0 0 && tput ed` for flicker-free updates
  - Other useful commands: `tput cup $row $col`, `tput el` (clear line), `tput sc/rc` (save/restore cursor)
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** Reviewed - Keep as reference
- **Review notes (2026-01-18):** Does not meet "recurring" criteria. Very specialized for interactive terminal scripts. Only 2 monitor scripts in brain repo use this. Low reuse potential. Keep as reference in GAP_BACKLOG for future monitor script work.

### 2026-01-18 — Bash Associative Arrays for Caching
- **Type:** Knowledge / Pattern
- **Why useful:** Improves performance by avoiding repeated expensive operations (parsing, computation) on immutable data
- **When triggered:** Implementing completed task caching in current_ralph_tasks.sh (task P4A.2)
- **Evidence:**
  - Used `declare -A COMPLETED_CACHE` to create associative array for key-value storage
  - Generated cache keys using `md5sum`: `cache_key=$(echo -n "$data" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)`
  - Checked cache: `if [[ -n "${CACHE[$key]}" ]]; then echo "${CACHE[$key]}"; fi`
  - Stored values: `CACHE[$key]="$value"`
  - Pattern useful for caching parsed data, computed results, or any immutable lookups
  - Current use case: Cache completed task display strings to skip title generation on refresh
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** Reviewed - Keep as reference
- **Review notes (2026-01-18):** Does not meet "recurring" criteria. General caching patterns already documented in skills/domains/caching-patterns.md. This is a bash-specific implementation detail with low reuse potential. Keep as reference for bash caching needs.
