It avoids alert noise by normalizing page content and only escalating high-severity issues.\n\n---\n\n## Critical\n\n### 1) Homepage is now `noindex`\n\n- URL: `https://example.com/`\n- Detected: meta robots changed from empty → `noindex,follow`\n- Why it matters: pages with `noindex` may be removed from search results.\n- Recommended action:\n  1. Check your CMS/SEO plugin settings for “Discourage search engines”.\n  2. Verify there is no environment toggle that accidentally set production to noindex.\n  3. Deploy fix and confirm the meta robots tag is removed.\n\n### 2) `robots.txt` now blocks `/blog/`\n\n- URL: `https://example.com/robots.txt`\n- Change: new rule `Disallow: /blog/`\n- Why it matters: search engines may stop crawling blog pages, causing traffic loss.\n- Recommended action:\n  1. Confirm intended behavior.\n  2. Revert unintended disallow.\n  3. Validate robots file in Search Console (if available).\n\n---\n\n## Warnings\n\n### 1) Pricing page canonical changed\n\n- URL: `https://example.com/pricing`\n- Change: canonical now points to `https://example.com/` (unexpected)\n- Why it matters: search engines may treat the pricing page as duplicate content.\n- Recommended action:\n  1. Check canonical tag generation in your theme/plugin.\n  2. Ensure self-referential canonical on pricing page.\n\n### 2) New 404s discovered (sample crawl)\n\n- Example broken URLs:\n  - `https://example.com/blog/old-post`\n  - `https://example.com/docs/getting-started-old`\n- Why it matters: broken internal links waste crawl budget and harm UX.\n- Recommended action:\n  1.

Check recent deploys for new scripts/images.\n  2. Verify caching and image optimization.\n\n---\n\n## Info\n\n### 1) Blog homepage content changed\n\n- URL: `https://example.com/blog/`\n- Detected: main content changed (normalized diff)\n- Interpretation: informational; not necessarily a regression.\n\n### 2) Sitemap URL count increased\n\n- URL: `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`\n- Count: 1200 → 1235\n- Interpretation: growth; verify new URLs are intended.\n\n---\n\n## What to do first (prioritized)\n\n1. Remove `noindex` from homepage.\n2. Fix `robots.txt` disallow for `/blog/` if unintended.\n3. Resolve canonical misconfiguration on pricing page.\n4.
