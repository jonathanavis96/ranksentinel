# Step 6 — Pricing & Packaging (RankSentinel)

This step defines the **pricing page content** (copy + tier table + clarifications) for RankSentinel.

Agent rule:

- Before changing tiers or pricing logic, **open and read** `skills/domains/marketing/strategy/pricing-strategy.md`.

## Required reading (agents must open these)

- `skills/domains/marketing/strategy/pricing-strategy.md`

## Competitor reference

- `docs/COMPETITOR_PRICING_SNAPSHOT.md`

---

## Pricing page copy (ready to embed)

## Hash / anchor system (required)

Pricing page anchors:

- `#top`
- `#what-you-get`
- `#plans`
- `#upgrade-triggers`
- `#pages-monitored`
- `#faq`

---

### Hero (anchor: #top)

**Pricing that scales with your site — without noisy alerts.**

Start small and upgrade when your monitoring footprint grows.

Primary CTA: **Start monitoring**  
Secondary CTA: **See sample report** (for proof)

### What you get (all plans) (anchor: #what-you-get)

- **Weekly SEO regression digest** (Critical / Warning / Info)
- **Daily critical alerts** (only when severity is Critical)
- **Key-page monitoring** (status, redirects, title, canonical, `noindex`, normalized content)
- **Sitemap-aware weekly sampling** (capped)
- **Action-first recommendations** (top priorities)

### Plans (anchor: #plans)

> Billing: monthly (annual option can be added later).

| Plan | Price | Best for | Included |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Starter** | **$29/mo** | 1 small site | 1 site, up to **50 pages monitored**, up to **10 key pages**, up to **3 recipients** |
| **Growth** | **$69/mo** | multiple sites or bigger footprint | up to **3 sites**, up to **200 pages monitored**, up to **25 key pages**, up to **10 recipients** |
| **Agency** | **$199/mo** | agencies + multi-site portfolios | up to **10 sites**, up to **2,000 pages monitored**, up to **100 key pages**, up to **25 recipients**, priority onboarding |

### Upgrade triggers (plain-English) (anchor: #upgrade-triggers)

Upgrade when:

- you need more **key pages** (daily monitoring + PSI)
- you want a larger **weekly sample crawl**
- you’re monitoring multiple sites

### What “pages monitored” means (keep this honest) (anchor: #pages-monitored)

RankSentinel’s MVP crawl model is:

- **Daily:** key pages only
- **Weekly:** sitemap sample crawl (capped)

So “pages monitored” means:

> Total pages monitored = key pages (daily) + weekly sampled pages (weekly cap)

### FAQ (pricing) (anchor: #faq)

**Do you crawl my entire site every day?**  
No. Daily monitoring is focused on your key pages. The weekly digest includes a capped sitemap sample crawl.

**Will I get spammed with alerts?**  
No. RankSentinel only sends daily emails when findings are **Critical**.

**Can I add another site later?**  
Yes — upgrade to Growth or Agency.

## Notes for future iteration

- If we add an annual plan later, anchor annual at ~2 months free (common pattern).
- If enterprise needs custom contracts, keep Agency as the highest self-serve tier and add “Enterprise — Contact” as a fourth option.
